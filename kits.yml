# EssentialsX kit configuration.
# If you don't have any kits defined in this file, the plugin will try to copy them from the config.yml

# Note: All items MUST be followed by a quantity!
# All kit names should be lower case, and will be treated as lower in permissions/costs.
# Syntax: - name[:durability] amount [enchantment:level]... [itemmeta:value]...
# For Item Meta information visit http://wiki.ess3.net/wiki/Item_Meta
# To make the kit execute a command, add /<command> to the items list. Use {USERNAME} to specify the player receiving the kit.
# {PLAYER} will show the player's displayname instead of username.
# 'delay' refers to the cooldown between how often you can use each kit, measured in seconds.
# Set delay to -1 for a one time kit.
